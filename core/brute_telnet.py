    """
    Attempt password guesses against a Telnet service using a wordlist.

    This function iterates over passwords from a file and attempts to authenticate
    to a Telnet server using the supplied username. It returns the first password
    that appears to successfully authenticate, or ``None`` if no password from
    the wordlist succeeds.

    Args:
        host (str): Target hostname or IP address of the Telnet server.
        username (str): Username to use for authentication attempts.
        wordlist_path (str): Path to a file containing candidate passwords,
            one password per line. The file is opened with UTF-8 and errors are
            ignored.
        port (int, optional): Telnet port to connect to. Defaults to 23.
        timeout (int | float, optional): Connection/read timeout in seconds
            passed to ``telnetlib`` operations. Defaults to 5.
        delay (float, optional): Delay in seconds between attempts to avoid
            overwhelming the target and to reduce likelihood of lockouts.
            Defaults to 1.0.

    Returns:
        Optional[str]: The password string if authentication appears successful,
        otherwise ``None`` if no password worked.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If ``wordlist_path`` does not exist or cannot be opened.
        OSError: For low-level socket/Telnet errors raised by ``telnetlib`` when
            opening the connection.
        Exception: Other unexpected exceptions may propagate from underlying
            telnet operations.

    Behavior and heuristics:
        * The function attempts to detect server prompts like "login:" / "username:"
          and "Password:" and writes the username and password accordingly.
        * After submitting credentials it reads available text from the server
          buffer and checks for indicators defined in the settings:
          ``TELNET_SUCCESS_INDICATORS`` and ``TELNET_FAILURE_INDICATORS``.
          These lists are used as simple heuristics to determine success or failure.
        * On a detected success the function prints a success message, closes the
          connection, and returns the password. On failure it prints a failure or
          diagnostic message and continues with the next password.
        * The function respects ``delay`` between attempts and closes Telnet
          connections in a finally block to avoid resource leaks.
        * Because server behavior varies, detection is heuristic and may yield
          false positives/negatives. Use additional verification on your test host
          if strict confirmation is required.

    Example:
        >>> found = telnet_bruteforce("192.168.56.101", "msfadmin", "/tmp/wordlist.txt")
        >>> if found:
        ...     print("Found password:", found)
        ... else:
        ...     print("No password found in wordlist.")

    Security note:
        * Run only against systems you control or have permission to test.
        * Increase ``delay`` and/or add rate-limiting if testing against networked
          targets to avoid triggering intrusion-detection or lockout mechanisms.
